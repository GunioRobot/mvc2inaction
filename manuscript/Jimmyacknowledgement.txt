Thanks to my wife, Sara, without whose love, support and continued patience, my contribution to this project would not be possible.  I also want to thank those who give back to the community through books, articles, blogs, code, presentations and events.  I would also like to thank all the masters who came before me and were kind enough to share their wisdom so that others may grow and learn.  Finally, I want to thank my parents and my family, who have over the years supported and guided me in my endeavors.
